# FBREF Percentile with Custom Colors

This Python script is designed to facilitate in-depth analysis and visualization of player statistics from FBREF through the generation of a highly customizable horizontal bar chart. The initial phase involves the extraction of player-specific details from FBREF, where special attention is given to mitigating potential order-related issues during web scraping. To address these concerns, the script strategically stores the acquired data in a CSV file and subsequently reads it back for further processing. Notably, users can tailor the visual representation of the data by choosing from a variety of colormaps, such as viridis or plasma, which are applied to the chart to convey percentiles through distinct and visually appealing colors. Additionally, the script allows users to fine-tune various aspects of the chart's appearance, including font size, font path for annotations, background color, and grid lines. The result is a comprehensive and adaptable tool that empowers users to gain valuable insights into player performance metrics from FBREF. The finalized chart is saved as a PNG file in the 'Output' directory, providing a tangible and shareable output for further analysis or presentation purposes.
